at first you need to request an access token by sending client_id, secret and few other pieces of info to the 
spotifys acc service, it then returns as a temp access token that has an expiry . Having that access token we can
send request to the web API which gives us info about artists tracks, playlists etc 

BASE64: 
    Some communication systems or protocols (like email and URLs) may have limitations on the types of characters 
    they can send or receive. Base64 allows binary data to be encoded in a text format that can be safely transmitted 
    over these systems.

UTF-P:
    Why UTF-8? Computers only understand bytes (which are numbers), but humans use a wide variety of characters
    (such as English letters, Chinese characters, emojis, etc.). UTF-8 is a way to encode all these characters as 
    bytes so that computers can process them.

TO GET ARTIST'S TOP TRACKS:
    search for an artist, and then grab the id from it (required in spotifys documentation)
